        <h2>The Future of Work</h2>
        <p class="big-inline">Technology continues to change our understanding of the world around us and in ways we had never imagined. Within 10 years, over half of the office occupations in the world will be displaced by technology. How do we manage this?
            <br> How do we capitalize on this? And where is tech leading the Future of Work?
            <br>
            <br> With Brexit, Cognitive HR, a possible global leadership crisis, and disruptions occurring in unpredictable ways, weâ€™ll be in London to help you navigate the changes and the possibilities interwoven with HR and tech.
